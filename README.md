##Question 1
-The program finds the longest string from an array that only contains valid characters and has no consecutive repeating characters.  
It validates inputs, filters strings based on a character set, and ensures character uniqueness before selecting the longest match.

#Question 2
-The codecalculates the number of unique combinations from an array that sum up to a target value using recursion.  
It includes input validation and uses a recursive helper method to explore inclusion and exclusion of elements.

Question 3
Here I am checking checks if an array can be reduced to all zeros by repeatedly subtracting the previous element from the current one in reverse order.  
It validates input and uses a backward iteration strategy to determine if the transformation is possible.


Question 4
The program identifies the first unique (non-repeating) product in a given array of product names.  
It uses a HashMap to count occurrences and returns the first product with exactly one appearance.

Question 5
in this question im finding the smallest distance between any two occurrences of the minimum value in an array.  
It first identifies the minimum, then calculates the closest gap between its repeated positions with input validation.

Question 6
This program identifies the top three most common words in a given sentence and returns them in alphabetical order.  
It uses a HashMap to count word frequencies and resolves ties using lexicographical comparison.

Question 7
The codes rotates a singly linked list to the right by `n` positions using a circular link and pointer adjustment.  
It calculates the list length, performs effective rotation, and breaks the cycle to return the new head.
